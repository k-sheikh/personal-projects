          <p id = "tribute-info"> <b>Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA</b> (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who was director of research at the <b>Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge</b> at the time of his death. He was the <b>Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge</b> between 1979 and 2009.<br> <br>
          
          Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of doctors. Hawking began his university education at University College, Oxford in October 1959 at the age of 17, where he received a <b>first-class BA (Hons.) degree in physics</b>. He began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in October 1962, where he obtained his <b>PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics</b>, specialising in general relativity and cosmology in March 1966. During this period—in 1963—Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (also known as <b>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)</b> or Lou Gehrig's disease) that gradually paralysed him over the decades. After the loss of his speech, he was able to communicate through a speech-generating device—initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle. <br> <br>
          
          Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called <b>Hawking radiation</b>. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the <b>many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics</b>.<br> <br>
          
          Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general. His book <b>A Brief History of Time</b> appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a <b>Fellow of the Royal Society</b>, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked number <b>25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons</b>. He died on 14 March 2018 at the age of 76, after living with motor neurone disease for more than 50 years.
