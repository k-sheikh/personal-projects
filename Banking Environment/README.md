# FatWest Bank Application

## Description

FatWest Bank Application is a simple, console-based banking system implemented in Python. It allows users to create accounts, perform basic banking operations like deposits and withdrawals, and manage user information securely.

## Features

- User registration and login system..
- Deposit and withdrawal functionality.
- Basic transaction validations.
- Secure password handling (future implementation).
- Ability to create multiple account types e.g., Savings, Current (future implementation).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/k-sheikh/personal-projects/tree/main/Banking%20Environment
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Banking Environment
   ```

## Usage

## Future Work

- **Database Integration**: Plan to implement a database system for persistent data storage and management.
- **Enhanced Security Measures**: Aim to implement password hashing and more robust security protocols to protect user data.
- **Advanced User Interface**: Development of a more sophisticated user interface for an improved user experience.
- **Additional Banking Features**: Include more complex banking features like account statements, online transfers, and loan management.
- **Modular Code Refactoring**: Intend to separate the current codebase into distinct modules, such as `user`, `account`, `bank`, and `utilities`, for better modularity and maintainability. This will enhance the organisation of the code, making it easier to navigate, update, and debug.

## Acknowledgments

- This project is developed as part of a learning exercise in software development and modular programming.
