					Nisa’s was created in 1999 using our family’s longstanding recipe,
					handed down from generation to generation, to provide the general
					public with an authentic and flavoursome experience. This allowed
					consumers an option to spend less time cooking and more time with
					their family whilst still enjoying the homemade quality food we all
					love.<br /><br />
					Ever since the birth of Nisa’s, we pride ourselves on producing the
					highest quality products whilst using freshly sourced vegetables and
					premium quality Halal meat.<br /><br />One by one, we have produced
					hundreds of millions of our samosas and spring rolls by hand,
					maintaining the premium quality and authentic taste. Straying away
					from the hand making process will be a cheaper process for us but we
					will not do anything to compromise on our quality and taste.
