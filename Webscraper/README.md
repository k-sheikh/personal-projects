# Webscraper

A python webscraper application that conducts a search for a user-defined product on https://www.newegg.com/ - the UK version of the site.

## Installation and use

Apart from having python 3.9 and higher, this application has no other prerequisites.\
Once you run the program in your chosen IDE, you will be able to select the appropriate option from the self-explanatory menu.

## Credit

This project was created as part of my self-study in python programming.
